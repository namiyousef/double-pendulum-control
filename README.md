# double-pendulum-control

TEST CHANGE
A project where a double pendulum system is controlled using reinforcement learning.

**Notes:**
- Need to create a *requirements.txt* for a virtualenv. Currently does not exist
- We'll need to define the differential equations for the systems, and then use an ODE solver to get values for different initial conditions
